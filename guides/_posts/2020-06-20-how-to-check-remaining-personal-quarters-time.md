In PSO2, you can gain access to your personal quarters by purchasing a premium set.
By access, I basically mean you can choose a different room layout and place more
than five items. Of course, if you don't want to throw down cash, you can always
opt for a 3-day pass. There are a few ways to get them, but perhaps the easiest
way is to exchange for them using the EX-cube shop. For 2 EX-cubes, you get 3 days
worth of personal quarters access. Even better, these passes stack.

Of course, chances are you already knew this. Now, you just want to know how to check
how much room time you have left. Fortunately, PSO2 does track this information,
so you don't have to. Unfortunately, finding this information is a bit of a pain.

First, you'll need to access the shopping menu (the icon looks like a shopping cart). 
This is the same menu which contains the Fresh Finds shop and the scratch tickets. 
From there, you'll want to access "Purchase History/Expiration". This will pop
up a menu which contains a few options:

- Purchase History
- Rental Expiration
- Back

Select "Rental Expiration" to be greeted with a window that details the expiration
date for several features including the Premium Set and the Personal Quarters.
In fact, you can find out just how much time remains on your personal quarters
at the very bottom of this list.
