When you finally figure out how to switch personal quarters,
you'll often be faced with a problem: **what happened to all the
furniture?** Fortunately, nothing actually happened to them.
All the furniture is still in the mini room. 

To get back to your mini room, head over to the personal terminal
and select "Change Rooms Used". From there, select the mini room, 
and you'll be transported back to the default room. At that point,
you can pick up all your items or use the "Remove All Furnishings"
command. Then, swap back to the new room and place your items
again. That's it!
